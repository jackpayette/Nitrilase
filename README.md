Description: A project containing python code using ete3, seaborn, and arviz for analysis of molecular clock data for Class I nitrilases.
Usage notes: Jupyter notebook (.ipynb), data files (.pkl, .chronogram, .labels from phylobayes - .datedist excluded),
figure files (.png,.svg), text files (.csv), tree files.

# Nitrilase molecular clock node age analysis

Caption: Molecular clock analyses including all calibrations predict a Class 1 nitrilase ancestor age between 1.88 and 1.02 Ga (Fig. 3, Table 1).
The estimated range and mean age for the Class 1 ancestor varies by clock model:
LN predicts the oldest age range (1.88-1.45 Ga) and mean (1.63 Ga),
CIR predicts the youngest age range (1.02-1.25 Ga) and mean (1.13 Ga),
and UGAM offers intermediate estimates for age range (1.57-1.18 Ga) and mean (1.32 Ga) of the Class 1 LCA.
